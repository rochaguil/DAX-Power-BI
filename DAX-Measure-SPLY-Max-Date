/*
Context
  We are comparing each year with its previous year.
Problem
  The current year is not finished yet and the last year amount must consider the same
period (same quantity of months)
  When a calendar table is used, the last day of the current year's month will be the 
last of the month and not the last date in the table
Solution
  1- Move the last date to the previous year using EDATE
  2- Use CALCULATE with two filter contexts:
    a) SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR and 
    b) filter only what is before the last date (1)
Obs
  1- The CALCULATE formula already excludes any filter context.
  2- SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR alone would consider the whole month

sply = 
//move the last date to the previous year with EDATE
var _last_dt = EDATE(MAXX(ALL('calendar'), [Date]) ,-12)

return
//use two filters: SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR and previous to the last date
CALCULATE([budget],
    SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('calendar'[Date]),
    'calendar'[Date] <= _last_dt)
